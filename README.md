## Introduction

This project consists of two parts:

1. **cnn_model**: A Python project to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the QuickDraw dataset developed by Google. With this Python code, you can train a simple CNN model to recognize hand-drawn sketches from the QuickDraw dataset.
2. **mobile_app**: A Flutter mobile app that utilizes the trained CNN model to predict drawings. Using this Flutter code, you can build a small app that allows users to draw on the screen and predicts the drawn object using the CNN model trained in the Python project.

## Categories

The table below lists the 20 categories that my model is trained to recognize:

| apple      | book   | bowtie    | candle   |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| cloud      | cup    | door      | envelope |
| eyeglasses | guitar | hammer    | hat      |
| ice cream  | leaf   | scissors  | star     |
| t-shirt    | pants  | lightning | tree     |
